# Face Detection and Recognition using OpenCV DNN

The [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bigvisionai/upgrad_alumni_workshop_day2/blob/master/face_recognition/OpenCV_DNN_Face_Detection_Recognition.ipynb) discusses the code for finding the embedding for faces using the [SFace (Sigmoid-Constrained Hypersphere Loss for Robust Face Recognition)](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/tree/master/models/face_recognition_sface) model. It also discusses how to use the model for Face Recognition.

The python file `opencv-face-authentication.py` runs the face authentication application using the webcam and allows you to 

* Enroll a Face
* Delist Faces
* Authenticate a new face
